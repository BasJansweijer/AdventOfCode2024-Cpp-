# AoC in C++
To learn c++ (in addition to other online resources) I solved up until day 14 of Advent of Code 2024.
After day 14, I felt reasonably confident with the language and moved on to real projects. 
Such as the chess engine project which can be found at [https://github.com/BasJansweijer/ChessBitBoards](https://github.com/BasJansweijer/ChessBitBoards)
